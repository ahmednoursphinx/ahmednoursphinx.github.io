# <span style="color:blue">Understanding Geometric Sequences</span>

## <span style="color:blue">Sequence</span>
A sequence is a set of things, usually numbers, in order. For example: 3, 5, 7, 9, ...

## <span style="color:blue">Geometric Sequence</span>
In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant (the common ratio).

**Example:** 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32  
This sequence has a common ratio of 2.

## <span style="color:blue">General Form</span>
The general form of a geometric sequence is:  
{ar⁰, ar¹, ar², ar³, ... , arⁿ⁻¹}  
Where:
- `a` is the first term
- `r` is the common ratio

In the example above: `a = 1`, `r = 2`.

## <span style="color:blue">Formula for the nth Term</span>
The formula for the nth term is:  
x(n) = arⁿ⁻¹

**Example:** For the sequence 10, 30, 90, 270:
- `a = 10`
- `r = 3`
- 4th term: `x(4) = 10 × 3³ = 270`

## <span style="color:blue">Sum of a Geometric Sequence</span>
The sum of the first `n` terms of a geometric sequence is:  

Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} arᵏ = a(1 - rⁿ)/(1 - r)


Where:
- `a` is the first term
- `r` is the common ratio
- `n` is the number of terms
- `∑` is the summation symbol

**Example:** Sum of first 4 terms of 10, 30, 90, 270:
- `a = 10`
- `r = 3`
- `n = 4`
- Sum = `10 × (1 - 3⁴)/(1 - 3) = 400`
